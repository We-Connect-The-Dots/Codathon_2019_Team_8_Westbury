        <p>Character traits can desribe a character. In the short story, "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" by Eric Carle, the caterpillar displays many character traits.</p>
        <p>One trait the caterpillar displays is determination. On page 2, after eating an apple, the author states, "On Tuesday, he ate through <b>2</b> pears, but he was still hungry. This shows that even though he was shamed upon for doing so, he still decided to eat more food to satisfy his hunger</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The caterpillar is <i>determined</i></li>
            <li>The caterpillar is <i>hungry</i></li>
            <li>The caterpillar <i>eats food</i></li>
        </ul>
